### Description

It's a common problem everyone has faced. You have a couple paragraphs of text that you want to store in a constant. But how do you manage quotation marks, line breaks, and backslashes in a quoted string?

This solution will let you paste text into a textbox, and it will spit out the source code in order to store that text properly in a variable. Outputs to Javascript, VBScript, VB6, VB.Net, C#, and HTML. Very handy!
